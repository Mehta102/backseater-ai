Real-time gameplay commentator using CV and LLMs - Final Year AI Project


Final-year Computer Science (AI) project exploring AI-driven live commentary for single-player games.

## Project Overview
Backseater AI observes gameplay in real-time and reacts like a live streamer or friend, using:
- **Computer Vision** (OpenCV + Tesseract) to detect on-screen events
- **Large Language Models** (GPT) to generate contextual commentary
- **Text-to-Speech** to speak responses aloud

## Current Status: Prototype Phase
**December 2025** – Building proof of concept with Tic-Tac-Toe

### What's Working:
- ✅ Basic Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation
- 🔄 CV event detection (in progress)
- ⏳ LLM integration (planned)
